# Introduction 

This project was designed to integrate with Statistic Canadaâ€™s The Zone platform. In The Zone, users can create individual workspaces with Kubeflow Notebooks. To persist their work, users can attach volumes to their notebooks. These volumes are not automatically deleted when a notebook is deleted. Users are free to move them or to reuse them. As a result, over time, users tend to amass several unused volumes. These volumes sit on the cloud and result in unnecessary costs. The purpose of this project is to design an automatic system that detects these unused volumes and safely removes them, reducing unnecessary expenditure. 

Despite being primarily designed for Statistics Canada, this project strongly values open-source practices. The codebase is available for public use on the [Github repository](https://github.com/StatCan/volume-cleaner), and the entire development process is documented on the [issues](https://github.com/StatCan/volume-cleaner/issues) page. The volume cleaner was designed to have as little coupling as possible so it can easily integrate into projects outside Statistics Canada. Using open-source and being open-source was an important development philosophy.
